                <p>
                    JavaScript(JS) is a high-level, lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class functions (functions in the language are treated like any other variable).
                    Inside a host environment (forexample, a web browster), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
                    Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions 
                            allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an 
                            application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li> 

                </ul>

                Each section will be blocked off into a section tag.

                There should be a total of 10 p elements in these sections.

                There should be at lest 5 code elements

                there should be at least 5 li elements
